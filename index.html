      Let <code>RTCRtpReceiver</code> objects have a
      <dfn>[[\PlayoutDelayHint]]</dfn> internal slot initially
      initialized to <code>null</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="idl">partial interface RTCRtpReceiver {
  attribute double? playoutDelayHint;
};</pre>
    <section>
      <h2>Attributes</h2>
      <dl data-link-for="RTCRtpReceiver" data-dfn-for="RTCRtpReceiver"
      class="attributes">
        <dt><dfn><code>playoutDelayHint</code></dfn> of type <span
          class="idlAttrType">double</span>, nullable</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>This attribute allows the application to give a hint to the User
          Agent about what playout delay is acceptable. The User Agent SHOULD
          NOT playout audio or video that is received unless this amount of time
          has passed in seconds, allowing the User Agent to perform more or less
          buffering than it might otherwise do. This allows to influence the
          tradeoffs between having a higher delay and the risk that buffers such
          as the jitter buffer will run out of audio or video frames to play due
          to network jitter. This API only serves to provide a hint, and the
          User Agent may ignore it. The hint SHOULD NOT be followed if it
          significantly impacts audio or video quality (e.g. bad network), or if
          the value implies allocating larger buffers than the User Agent is
          willing to provide.</p>
          <p>On getting, this attribute MUST return the value of the
          <a>[[\PlayoutDelayHint]]</a> internal slot.</p>
          <p>On setting, the User Agent MUST run the following steps:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Let <var>receiver</var> be the
              <code><a>RTCRtpReceiver</a></code> object on which the setter is
              invoked.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Let <var>delay</var> be the argument to the setter.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>If <var>delay</var> is negative, <a>throw</a> an
              <code>InvalidAccessError</code> and abort these steps.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Set the value of <var>receiver</var>'s
              <a>[[\PlayoutDelayHint]]</a> internal slot to
              <var>delay</var>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>In parallel, begin executing the following steps:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>Update the underlying system about the new delay hint, or
                  that there is no hint if <var>delay</var> is
                  <code>null</code>. If at any point in time this value is
                  larger than the User Agent is able or willing to provide, the
                  User Agent SHOULD use the maximum value available to match the
                  requested delay as close as possible. If at any point in time
                  this value is smaller than the User Agent determines is needed
                  in order provide sufficient audio or video quality, the User
                  Agent SHOULD use the smallest value possible.</p>
                  <p class="note">
                    If User Agent ignores the hint at any time, this is not
                    reflected in the <a>[[\PlayoutDelayHint]]</a> internal slot.
